<p>My name is Valencia Yasin.I was born on November 25,2000 in Columbia,South Carolina.
I was raised in columbia until age 13 then I moved here to Greenville.I enjoy Greenville more than Columbia because Greenville
is a smaller cleaner version of Columbia. When I got here I went to Beck Academy and was voted most dependable it was special becuase I
was never voted anything and it was funny because you can never depend on me to do homework. </p>

<ol>
  <li>When I was 8 and 12 I went to diseny land and I enjoyed <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/">Disneyland</a>
  and Animal Kingdom was the best.</li>
  <li>I learned how to cook at age 12, now i make chicken better than my grandma.</li>
  <li>I passed all of middle school with A's and B's.</li>
  <li>I had a dog named Candy but we had to give her away to my aunt because dogs aren't allowed where we stay now.</li>
  <li>I finally got my own room when we moved to Greenville.</li>

<p>I live in an apartment with my mother and a 11 year old sister,I have a brother but he lives in Columbia.My family is crazy,
we tell corny jokes.My home is full of laughter. We love to dance,when a good song comes on you can catch us three
dancing.We all collect things,not on purpose but it's just the things we have most of,my mom collects wrist watche bands,I
collect shoes and put them on my wall, and my sister collects junk on her bedroom floor.</p>
    <p> My family in columbia are pretty laid back. When everyone hears that we are coming home for the weekend, they all gather
   at my aunt bell house and hang,maybe even throw something on the grill.My dad's side of the family are more on the boring side.
   My grandparents are old and all we talk about is school and what college I'm going to. The fun things we do with my dad's side
  of the family is go to Disney every year and we have our family reunions.For our reunions we go to a big park called <a href="southcarolinaparks.com/sesqui/introduction.aspx
">Sesquicentenial State Park</a>.It has a lake and a big walking trial, you can talk little paddle boats on the lake.  </p>
